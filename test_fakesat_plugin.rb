puts "=== OpenC3 COSMOS FakeSat Plugin Test ==="
puts
puts "This script demonstrates the plugin's command/telemetry interactions:"
puts

puts "1. BASIC COMMANDS:"
puts "   NOOP - Basic connectivity test"
puts "   CLEAR - Clear all counters"
puts "   SET_MODE - Change spacecraft mode (SAFE/CHECKOUT/OPERATE)"
puts

puts "2. THERMAL CONTROL:"
puts "   HTR_SETPT NUM:1 SETPT:30.0 - Set heater 1 setpoint to 30°C"
puts "   HTR_CTRL NUM:1 STATE:ON - Enable heater 1 control"
puts "   → Watch THERMAL telemetry for temperature regulation"
puts

puts "3. POWER MANAGEMENT:"
puts "   SLRPNLDEPLOY NUM:1 - Deploy solar panel 1"
puts "   SLRPNLDEPLOY NUM:2 - Deploy solar panel 2"
puts "   → Watch MECH telemetry for power generation increase"
puts

puts "4. AUTONOMOUS CONTROL:"
puts "   ADCS_CTRL STATE:ON - Enable automatic solar panel pointing"
puts "   → Watch MECH telemetry - panels will track sun automatically"
puts

puts "5. IMAGE COLLECTION:"
puts "   SET_MODE OPERATE - Must be in OPERATE mode first"
puts "   COLLECT TYPE:NORMAL DURATION:5.0 - Start 5-second collection"
puts "   → Watch IMAGER telemetry during collection"
puts "   → IMAGE packet will be generated when complete"
puts

puts "6. TEST FEATURES:"
puts "   SET_TEST_TEMP NEW_TEMP:25.5 - Set test temperature"
puts "   → Watch HEALTH_STATUS.TEST_TEMP telemetry"
puts

puts "=== TELEMETRY PACKETS TO MONITOR ==="
puts
puts "HEALTH_STATUS (1Hz): Command counters, mode, CPU power, test temp"
puts "THERMAL (1Hz): Temperature sensors, heater status and power"
puts "ADCS (10Hz): Position, velocity, attitude, star tracking"
puts "MECH (1Hz): Solar panel angles/states/power, battery level"
puts "IMAGER (1Hz): Collection status, imager power"
puts "EVENT (as needed): Command responses and system events"
puts "IMAGE (after collection): Image data packets"
puts

puts "=== REALISTIC SIMULATION FEATURES ==="
puts
puts "• Power system: Solar panels generate power based on sun angle"
puts "• Thermal control: Heaters maintain temperature with hysteresis"
puts "• Mode restrictions: Some commands only work in specific modes"
puts "• Battery simulation: Power consumption affects battery level"
puts "• Orbital dynamics: Position/attitude data from real orbital files"
puts "• Command validation: Invalid parameters are rejected with events"
puts

puts "=== FIXED ISSUES ==="
puts
puts "✅ Added missing TEST_TEMP telemetry field"
puts "✅ Fixed CELSIUS spelling in thermal telemetry"
puts "✅ Fixed undefined variable references in simulation"
puts "✅ Plugin ready for use!"
puts

puts "Load the plugin in OpenC3 and start testing!"
